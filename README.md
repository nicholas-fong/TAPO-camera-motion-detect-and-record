# TAPO-camera-motion-detect-and-record <br>
Python script using RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) to (1) acquire video frames, (2) detect motion using opencv library (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) and (3) save video clips locally or to a NAS using ffmpeg. 
<br>
The script is tuned for consumer TAPO cameras (e.g. C200) and optimized to keep CPU load to a minimum.
