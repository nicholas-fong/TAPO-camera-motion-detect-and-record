# Tapo C200 camera issue

TAPO C200 Camera has internal IR filter and LED that activates during sun set and deactivates during sun rise. This automatic action produces a hard crash. A power cycle is needed to reset.

There are several work around but none is satisfactory:

(1) Disable the "night vision IR" but recent firmware and Tapo App deleted that ability.

(2) Use a light to illuminate camera's capture zone, but this wastes energy and money.

(3) COnnect the C200 to a smart plug and manually (or programmatically) cycle the power before darkness and after brightness. 

There is no satisfactory solution for C200 problem.

According to community group, Tapo C210 has nearly solved the IR issue and the Tapo app can disable the IR.
