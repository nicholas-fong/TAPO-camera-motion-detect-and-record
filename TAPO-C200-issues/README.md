# Tapo C200 camera issue

TAPO C200 Camera has internal IR filter and LED that activates during sun set and deactivates during sun rise. 

This automatic action could produce a hard crash. A power cycle is needed to reset.

There are three work arounds but none is satisfactory:

(1) Disable the "night vision IR" but recent firmware or Tapo App removed all that.

(2) Use a light to illuminate camera's capture zone so that it does not activate IR night mode, but this wastes energy and money.

(3) Connect the C200 to a smart plug and manually (or programmatically) cycle the power before darkness and after brightness. 

There is no satisfactory solution for this C200 problem.

According to community group, a newer model Tapo C210 has nearly solved the IR issue, plus the Tapo App can disable the IR on the C210.
